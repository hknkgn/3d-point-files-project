# 3d-point-files-project
 This project takes point data from files and performs certain mathematical operations.

It calculates the information of the closest and farthest points to each other, the edge point information of the cube including all the points, the center points entered by the user and the information of the point or points within the sphere whose radius is determined, and the average of the distances of the points to each other. It then sends this information to a file named 'output.nkt'.
